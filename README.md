# Pico4EyeTracking
 Personal hardware/software project for adding eye tracking to the Pico 4 HMD

The device is built inside an AMVR Facial Interface I got from amazon for the pico 4
The printed parts in the build are found in https://github.com/CucFlavius/Pico4EyeTracking/tree/main/Hardware/3D%20Model%20Prototyping/Max%20Project/export
and they are EspHolder.obj, EspHolderLid.obj, IRMountALeft.obj, IRMountARight.obj, IRMountBLeft.obj, IRMountBRight.obj
